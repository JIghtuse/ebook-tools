Requirements
------------
This project depends on:

- libzip which you can get from http://www.nih.at/libzip/

- libxml2 which you can get from http://xmlsoft.org/ 

- cmake (www.cmake.org)

To use the lit2epub script you also need to have:

- clit (or convertlit) from http://www.convertlit.com/

- zip I used the one from http://www.info-zip.org/

note that clit might be not legal in some countries, so check it before
you decide to download it.

Install
-------
Installing is pretty simple

cmake . 

works fine in most cases do ccmake . if you have to fiddle with the 
configuration for some reason.

make

make install
